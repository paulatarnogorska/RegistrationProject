### How to run the project

1. Ensure you have selenium drivers for different browsers: 
[firefox](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
[chrome](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
   
2. Edit the driver path in the constructor in `src/test/java/stepDefinitions/Methods.java` 
   to reflect the path where you have stored your drivers.
